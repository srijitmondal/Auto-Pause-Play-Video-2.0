# Auto-Pause-Play-Video-2.0
Auto Pause/Play Video is a convenient Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by automatically managing video playback when switching between tabs. This extension ensures that your videos are paused when you leave the tab and resume playing when you return, helping you save bandwidth and stay focused on your current task.

## Features:

- Automatic Video Pausing: Instantly pauses any playing video when you navigate away from the tab, preventing unnecessary background noise and bandwidth usage.
- Seamless Playback Resumption: Automatically resumes video playback when you return to the tab, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted viewing experience.
- Universal Compatibility: Works on all websites that host video content, including popular platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, and more.
- Lightweight and Efficient: Designed to be lightweight with minimal impact on your browser's performance.

## How It Works:

The extension utilizes Chrome's scripting capabilities to detect tab visibility changes and control video elements accordingly. When a tab becomes hidden, it pauses all video elements on the page. When the tab becomes visible again, it resumes the video playback.

## Permissions:

- Tabs and Active Tab: To detect when you switch between tabs.
- Scripting: To inject the necessary scripts into web pages for controlling video playback.
- Access to All URLs: To ensure functionality across all websites, allowing the extension to pause and play videos regardless of the site you are on.

## Installation:
- Download and install the extension from the Chrome Web Store.
- Enable the extension in your browser's extensions settings.
- Enjoy automated video management while you browse the web!

## Privacy:

Auto Pause/Play Video does not collect or store any personal data. It only interacts with video elements on the web pages you visit to control playback based on tab visibility.
